Zero-effort JSON reading/writing on Arduino platforms.

The COJSON library facilitates automated code generation from a JSON sample via
web interface https://hutorny.in.ua/codegen/cojson.html

The library is a cross-platform, zero-allocation, zero-dependency, 
small footprint implementation of a pull-type JSON parser for JSON model 
defined in an application with C++ language features.
